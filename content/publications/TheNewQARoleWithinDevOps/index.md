The role of a Quality Engineer, in our opinion, is to empower teams by focusing on quality. Quality Engineers bring expertise in software testing, test automation, agile processes, CI/CD, and DevOps, among other things. Everything has an impact on software quality, and thatâ€™s why QE must have great knowledge of all aspects of software development from software design, architecture, technology stack, delivery process, etc.
